# Elixir.sh
A simple bash script for refreshing your Ubuntu-based GNU-Linux operating system when it becomes slow or low on storage space.

The purpose of this script is to provide a low-effort/high-impact sweep of your system in the event that it becomes choked on resources, to quickly free up needed disc space and correct a variety of issues that can negatively affect your performance and operability.  This script is based on a MacOS-exclusive Automator script called 'Resurrection' which was created for the same purpose.

Elixir.sh is written in bash and executed from the same directory with
  bash elixir.sh
